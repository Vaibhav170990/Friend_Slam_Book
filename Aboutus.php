			<header>What is SlamBook? </header>
		<article>
			A paper notebook passed between peers at a school, in which they write mean things about ("slam") classmates and others.
			Lolz. Here we dont have a notebook to pass-on. The thing we have is a cool lappy that you are holding (Hey!! But that doesn't mean that guys or gals having cell-phones, tablets, PC's are deprecated), a bearable network to internet and obviously your thumbs in case of cells and your fingers in case of PC's or lappys.
			Enough of Bla Bla Bla!!! 
			
			The moto behind this is to let our mates (not maids :D) write good about you (That is an ideal condition like those of we read in Physics and all).
			Seriously are you kidding (Friends will never write gud atleast best friends will never. :D)
			
			Now finally you are given wid an all new E-slambook. Share it and Enjoy!! Cheers!!
